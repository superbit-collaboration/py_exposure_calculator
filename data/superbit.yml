# Names of the bands. Note thoughput file of a particula band should follow the following convention [name].csv
bands: ["u", "b", "g", "r", "i", "lum", "ha"]

# low and high cut off of the bands wavelength in nanometers
llo: [300, 350, 475, 550, 700, 375, 642]
lhi: [400, 500, 550, 800, 1100, 700, 667]

# fwhm of psf in milliarcseconds for every band. If psfs = 0 then the system will be treated as diffraction limited
